Project Overview: MyToken
MyToken is an Ethereum-based smart contract designed to create and manage a simple token named SUBSTANCE (symbol: SUB). It includes public variables to store the token's name, symbol, and total supply. The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to their token balances, allowing for efficient balance management. The contract features two core functions: mintTokens and burnTokens. The mintTokens function enables the creation of new tokens, which are added to a specified address's balance and increase the overall total supply. Conversely, the burnTokens function allows for the destruction of tokens from a specified address, decreasing both the address's balance and the total supply, with built-in checks to ensure that no address can burn more tokens than it holds. This project highlights basic token management capabilities, serving as a foundational example for more complex token implementations in the blockchain ecosystem.
